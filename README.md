#Shorthest path- dijkstra
Simple demonstration with graph

Made small graph for Shortest path Dijkstra algorithm and gave solution for Shortest path as possible. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.
Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Since initially no path is known to any other vertex than the source itself (which is a path of length zero), all other tentative distances are initially set to infinity. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.Then show all edges and vertexes as dictionary and shortest distance between them.
